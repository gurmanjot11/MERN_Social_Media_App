# Social_Media_App
I developed a seamless social media platform using Javascript and the MERN framework. I decided to prepare myself for industry standard software development, which is why I decided to use a MERN framework over a standard HTML, CSS implementation. Not only would a social media webpage teach me these skills, they also hammer down on object-oriented concepts that are used to initialize objects such as users and posts.  

Tools: Javascript, MongoDB, Node.js, React.js

By implementing React.js, the webpage offers an interactive front-end interface consisting 15+ intricately designed custom components, layouts, and widgets. Altogether the general look of the page resembles the sophistication of leading social media platforms. 

The back-end is built on a Node.js/Express.js service. It provides the servives advertised by the front-end (i.e. dark mode, posting, commenting), enabling swift user activity. By making CRUD API calls to the front-end it smoothly controls the flow of all button clicks. All posts and users; in fact 20+ entities are currently maintained in a linked MongoDB database. 


Side Note: Initially I did not have the idea to post this to github so the file uploads are quite unconventional, for future projects I have accustomed myself with git tools.
